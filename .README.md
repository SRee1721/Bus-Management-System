🚍 Bus Management & Real-Time Tracking System

A complete web-based system designed to automate college bus attendance, track buses live, and help students plan their travel efficiently.
This project was built as part of SSN’s Internally Funded Project (IFP) initiative.

📌 Overview

This system replaces manual bus attendance with a fully automated solution using ML-based facial recognition on Raspberry Pi devices.
Admins get a dashboard to manage buses, edit routes, track every bus live, monitor Pi camera feeds, and download attendance reports.
Students get a portal to check bus availability, choose source/destination stops, and track the buses live.

✨ Key Features
👨‍💼 Admin Features

Student Authentication Setup
Admin verifies a student and sends login credentials via email.

Student Registration + Face Data Collection
A dedicated Flask microservice is used to collect student details and capture facial data.
Stored securely in Firebase.

Live Bus Tracking
View the real-time location of every bus on a map using GPS data from Raspberry Pi.

Route Management
Add, edit, delete stops and manage the default route for each bus.

Raspberry Pi Monitoring
Each bus has a Pi + camera module.
Vision feed + attendance are streamed to Firebase using ngrok.
Admin can monitor the live feed from the dashboard.

Attendance Reports
Download individual and bus-wise attendance logs for any date.

🎓 Student Features

Bus Discovery
Students enter their source and destination stops, and the system shows all available buses.

Live Bus Tracking
Students can see the buses moving in real time to plan their commute.

Clean Web Interface
Built using React for fast and smooth usage.

🧩 System Architecture
Raspberry Pi → Firebase → Node.js Backend → React Admin Panel
                         ↘→ React Student Portal
Flask Microservice → Firebase (Face Data)


Flow:

Pi captures face + GPS → sends to Firebase via ngrok

Node backend manages buses, routes, and reports

React admin panel shows live tracking, attendance, Pi feed

Student portal shows available buses and live map

Flask microservice handles face data registration separately

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend

React.js (Admin Dashboard + Student Portal)

Backend

Node.js + Express.js (APIs for buses, routes, attendance)

Python Flask (Student registration + face data microservice)

Database & Auth

IoT & ML

Raspberry Pi 4 + Camera Module

InsightFace for facial recognition

GPS module

ngrok for tunneling

Deployment

Render (for Flask microservice)

Firebase Hosting (optional for frontend)

Raspberry Pi locally connected to the bus

Tools

Git/GitHub for version control

Postman for API testing
